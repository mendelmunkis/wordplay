Wordplay Version 8                           05-05-19

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Wordplay is an anagram finder.  What is an anagram?  Well, let's turn to
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition:

Definition:  anagram:  a word or phrase made by transposing the letters
		       of another word or phrase.  

Each letter in the anagram must appear in the same frequency as in the 
original string.

For example, the letters in the word "stop" can be rearranged to spell
"tops" or "pots" or "sotp".  "sotp" is not a word and is not of interest
when generating anagrams.  "stop" has four letters, so there are 24 ways
to rearrange its letters.  However, very few of the rearrangements actually
spell words.  

Wordplay, by using a list of words, takes a specified string of letters and 
uses the list of words to find anagrams of the string.  

By the way, "Wordplay" anagrams to "Rowdy Pal", and the program really can
live up to that particular anagram.  I have been able to come up with
anagrams of most of my coworkers' names that are humorous, descriptive,
satirical, or, occasionally, quite vulgar.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling the program:

Wordplay can be compiled by running.
  make wordplay

This assumes your native "cc" is an ANSI compiler.  If not, it WILL NOT WORK.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

To use the program, simply invoke the program with a combination of options
that make sense together.  Here is the format:

     wordplay string [-silxavnXmXdX] [-w word] [-f wordfile]

where the capital X's represent integers.  Please see the examples below
the option descriptions.  The square brackets are not part of the command
line.  They simply are used to show that the options they surround are
optional.

wordplay:              This is the name of the executable (under UNIX) after 
		       you have compiled the program.  Under other 
		       environments, method of invocation may vary.

string:                This should be seen to the program AS A SINGLE
		       ARGUMENT.  If you feel you must put spaces in the
		       string, under UNIX, you will have to put backslashes
		       in front of the spaces or just put the entire string
		       in double quotes.  Just leave the spaces out because
		       the program throws them out anyway.  Under environments
		       other than UNIX, you may be forced to omit them anyway,
		       like under MS-DOS or OS/2 .

Other options:

  s:  Silent operation.  If this option is used, the header and line
      numbers are not printed.  This is useful if you want the output to
      contain only the anagrams.  Use this option with the l (and x) option
      to generate a wordlist which can be piped or redirected.
      
      This option does not suppress error messages that are printed to 
      stderr.  Finding zero anagrams is not an error.

  i:  Allow input string to appear in the list of anagrams. If this option is
      omitted the input will not be counted as an anagram.

  l:  Print list of candidate words before anagramming.  This is the list of 
      words that can be spelled with the letters from the specified string,
      with no letters being used more often that they appear in the input
      string.

  x:  Do not perform anagramming.  Use with l if you just want the 
      candidate word list without anagrams.

  a:  Allow anagrams containing two or more occurrences of a word.

  v:  Consider strings with no vowels as candidate words and do not give
      up when there are no vowels remaining after extractions.

  m:  Limit candidate word length to a maximum number of letters.
      Follow by an integer.  m12 means limit words to 12 letters.
      m5 means limit them to 5 letters.

  n:  Limit candidate word length to a minimum number of letters.
      Follow by an integer.  n2 means limit words to 2 letters.
      n11 means limit them to 11 letters.

  d:  Limit number of words in anagrams to a maximum number.  
      Follow by an integer.  d3 means no anagrams should contain more
      than 3 words.  d12 means limit anagrams to 12 words.  This is
      currently the option that I recommend to limit output, since
      an optimization has been added to speed execution in some cases
      when this option is used.

  w:  Specify a word which should appear in all anagrams.  This is useful
      if you already have a word in mind that you want in the anagrams. 
      This option should be specified at the end of the command, followed
      by a space and the word to use.

  f:  Specify which word list to use.  See example!  This option should
      be specified at the end of the command, followed by a space and the 
      alternate wordfile name.  This is useful if you have other word lists
      to try or if you are interested in making your own customized word
      list.

      New feature:  Use a hyphen as the filename if the wordlist should
      be read from stdin. 


Examples of usage:

(1)
wordplay persiangulf 

     Anagram the string "persiangulf" .

(2)
wordplay anagramming -lx

     Print the list of words from the wordlist that can be spelled by using
     the letters from the word "anagramming".  A letter may not be used more
     often than the number of times it occurs in the word "anagramming".
     No anagrams are generated. 

(3)
wordplay tomservocrow -n3m8

     Anagram the string "tomservocrow" .  Do not use words shorter than 
     3 letters or longer than 8 letters.

(4)
wordplay persiangulf -ld3m10 -f /usr/dict/words

     Print the candidate words for the string "persiangulf".
     Print anagrams containing up to 3 words, without considering any
     words longer than 10 characters.  Usr the file "/usr/dict/words"
     rather than "words721.txt".

(5)
wordplay soylentgreen -n3w stolen -f w2     or
wordplay soylentgreen -n3 -w stolen -f w2   or
wordplay soylentgreen -n3f w2 -w stolen     or
wordplay soylentgreen -n3 -f w2 -w stolen   (get the idea?)

     Print anagrams of "soylentgreen" containing the word "stolen" and
     use the file "w2" as the wordlist file.  Discard candidate words 
     shorter than 3 characters.

(6)
wordplay university -slx

     Print the candidate word list for the string "university".  The
     output will consist of just the words.  This output is more useful
     for redirecting to a file or for piping to another program.

(7)
wordplay trymeout -s

    Anagram the string "trymeout" and print the anagrams with no line
    numbers.  The header will not be printed.  This is useful for piping
    the output to another process (or saving it to a file to be used
    by another program) without having to parse the output to remove the
    numbers and header.

(8)
wordplay trymeout -v

    Anagram "trymeout" as usual, but in case vowel-free strings are in
    the wordlist, consider them as possible candidate words.

(9)  UNIX ONLY!
cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 | sort -u | wordplay trymeout -f -

    Anagram "trymeout" and read the wordlist from stdin, so that, in
    this case, under UNIX, the three wordlists "wordlist1", "wordlist2",
    and "wordlist3" will be concatenated and piped into wordplay as
    the wordlist.  The "sort -u" is there to remove duplicate words
    from the combined wordlist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the "f" option to specify a word file:

If the option specifiers are combined, as in "an7m7d5f" or "d3n5f", the f 
should come last, followed by a space and the word list file, as shown in 
example number 4 above.

The "w" option is used in the same manner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Limit the number of words to consider, if desired, using the n and m options,
or better yet, use the d option to limit depth, when anagramming certain 
time-consuming strings.  The program is currently optimized to speed execution
in some cases when the d option is used.

Plurals and past tenses

The words721.txt does not contain plural forms of nouns obtained by adding "s"
or "es".  It usually does not contain verb forms obtained by adding "ed" or
"d", and it does not contain many adjective forms obtained by adding "y".
If the string you are anagramming contains an "s", try anagramming the 
string without the "s" and add an "s" in the output.  This trick may also
work effectively with "d" and "y".

Apostrophes, hyphens, and other non-alphabetics

All non-alphabetic characters in a word are preserved, INCLUDING BLANKS!!!
If you have a dictionary with words like "DON'T", "ONE-EYED", and
"ATOMIC NUMBER", each will be correctly processed.  Note that words
like "ATOMIC NUMBER" or "KNOW IT ALL" in your word list will be considered
as a single word by the program!  If "ATOMIC" and "NUMBER" appear as 
single words also, "ATOMIC NUMBER" will appear twice in the output, once
as a one-word anagram and once as a two-word anagram.  This is not a flaw
in the program.  The words721.txt word list does not contain "double words",
but other dictionaries do contain such things.

The "words721.txt" wordfile:

If no wordfile is specified, "words721.txt" is used.  It is highly 
recommended that the "words721.txt" file distributed with the program be 
used, since many nonsense two and three-letter combinations that are not 
words have been eliminated.  This makes the quality of the output slightly 
better and speeds execution of the program a slight bit.  Any word list may 
be used, as long as there is one word per line.  Feel free to create your 
own custom word list and use it instead.  The word list does not have to be 
sorted in any particular way.
